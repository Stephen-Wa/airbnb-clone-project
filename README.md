UI/UX Design Planning

Color Styles

The color palette is inspired by Airbnb’s Design Language System (DLS), designed to evoke trust, warmth, and a sense of belonging while ensuring accessibility for a global audience. Below is the list of color styles used in the project:





Primary Color: #FF385C (Raush Pink) - Used for primary buttons (e.g., “Book Now”), links, and key call-to-action elements to inspire confidence and action.



Secondary Color: #008489 (Babu Teal) - Applied to secondary buttons, icons, and accents to complement the primary palette and add visual interest.



Accent Color: #FFB400 (Kazan Yellow) - Highlights special features, such as promotions or “Superhost” badges, to draw attention.



Error Color: #D93900 (Red) - Indicates errors, warnings, or invalid form inputs, ensuring clarity in user feedback.



Neutral Background: #F7F7F7 (Off-White) - Used for backgrounds to create a clean, inviting canvas that enhances readability.



Text Primary: #222222 (Dark Gray) - Primary text color for high contrast and legibility across devices.



Text Secondary: #717171 (Medium Gray) - Used for captions, placeholders, or secondary information like host details.

All colors comply with WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards, maintaining a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for interactive elements to ensure usability for all users, including those with visual impairments.

Typography

Typography is designed to reflect Airbnb’s approachable and inclusive brand while ensuring readability and consistency across the platform. The following typography styles are defined:





Font Family:





Primary: Circular (Sans-serif) - Airbnb’s custom typeface, chosen for its friendly, modern, and approachable aesthetic.



Fallback: Proxima Nova, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif - Ensures compatibility across devices if Circular is unavailable.



Font Weights:





Light (300): Used for captions, secondary text, or subtle UI elements like timestamps.



Regular (400): Standard weight for body text, descriptions, and general content.



Medium (500): Applied to subheadings, button text, or emphasized content like pricing.



Bold (700): Used for headings, titles, and prominent calls-to-action like “Explore Now.”



Font Sizes:





H1 (Heading 1): 34px - Primary headings for page titles (e.g., “Welcome to Airbnb”).



H2 (Heading 2): 26px - Section headings (e.g., “Featured Listings”).



H3 (Heading 3): 22px - Subsection headings (e.g., “Amenities”).



Body Text: 16px - Standard text for property descriptions, reviews, and general content.



Caption/Small Text: 14px - Used for footnotes, labels, or secondary details like check-in instructions.



Button Text: 16px - Ensures legibility for interactive elements like “Reserve.”



Line Height:





Headings: 1.3 (130%) - Balanced spacing for visual impact.



Body Text: 1.5 (150%) - Optimized for readability in multilingual content and longer descriptions.



Letter Spacing:





Headings: 0.2px - Slightly increased for clarity in larger text.



Body Text: normal - Standard spacing for ease of reading.

The typography system supports Airbnb’s global audience by ensuring compatibility with multiple languages and scripts, with a modular scale (base size of 16px, 1.2x multiplier) for consistent sizing.

Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup Design

Defining design properties in a mockup is essential for creating a cohesive, user-friendly, and brand-aligned experience for an Airbnb-like platform. Mockups translate wireframes into high-fidelity designs, incorporating colors, typography, and layouts that reflect the platform’s goals of trust, accessibility, and inspiration. Here’s why identifying these properties is critical:





Reinforces Brand Identity: A consistent color palette (e.g., Airbnb’s Raush Pink) and typography (e.g., Circular) align the interface with Airbnb’s brand, evoking warmth and belonging. This strengthens user trust, crucial for a platform where users book homes or experiences from strangers.



Enhances User Trust and Clarity: Clear typography (e.g., 16px body text with 1.5 line height) and accessible colors (e.g., high-contrast text) ensure that critical information—like pricing, cancellation policies, or host reviews—is easy to read. This transparency builds confidence in booking decisions.



Supports Visual Hierarchy for Booking Flows: Design properties guide users through complex flows, such as searching for listings or completing reservations. For example, bold headings for property titles and vibrant buttons for “Book Now” prioritize key actions, while secondary text for details like check-in times reduces cognitive load.



Streamlines Development and Collaboration: Precise design specifications (e.g., hex codes like #FF385C, font sizes in pixels) in mockups enable developers to implement the UI accurately. This is especially important for an Airbnb-like project with mobile and web interfaces requiring pixel-perfect consistency.



Facilitates Multilingual and Global Accessibility: Airbnb operates globally, so typography and colors must support diverse languages and cultural contexts. Defining properties like font fallbacks and scalable sizes ensures the design adapts to right-to-left scripts or varying text lengths without breaking the layout.



Drives Emotional Engagement: Airbnb’s mission is to create a sense of belonging. Colors like pink and teal, paired with friendly typography, evoke excitement and trust, encouraging users to explore new destinations. Mockups allow designers to test these emotional cues early, refining them based on user feedback.

By defining design properties in mockups, the project ensures a seamless, inclusive, and inspiring experience that aligns with Airbnb’s mission to connect travelers and hosts worldwide.
